# Getting started
1. Install Tampermonkey.
2. Pick any script you want to install
3. Copy the code from the script into a new script in Tampermonkey.
4. Press save and then reload the page that the script is meant to be running on.


## Details

In the Tampermonkey dashboard, click on the "Add a new script" button. This will open a new editor window where you can write or paste your userscript. Enter the code for your userscript in the editor window. Make sure to include the correct metadata at the top of the script, as this is required for Tampermonkey to recognize it. The metadata should include the @name, @match and @description fields, which specify the name of the script and the URL pattern that it should run on.

Once you have entered your userscript code, click on the "Save" button to save it. Your userscript will now appear in the list of installed scripts in the Tampermonkey dashboard.
